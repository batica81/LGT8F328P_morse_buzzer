# LGT8F328P_morse_buzzer
Sine wave Morse buzzer


The project has to be run on a LGT8F328P based board because it uses analog output pin (8 bit DAC)!

This is just a proof of concept program, playing a nice sounding sine wave instead of not so nice square wave
that microcontrolers and buzzers usually give us. 
It is intended to grow to a propper sine wave Morse buzzer, or even a keyer, while using as little components as possible.

---

Connect D4 DAC pin to headphones or an amplified speaker. 
For a very simple sine wave Morse buzzer, connect Morse key in between.

The program is created by YU4HAK, based on code snippets found here and there, 
and is free in every possible sense, no attribution needed.
